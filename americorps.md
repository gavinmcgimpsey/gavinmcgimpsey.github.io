In 2012 I served in [AmeriCorps NCCC](https://americorps.gov/serve/fit-finder/americorps-nccc), a program for young adults to serve in teams assisting nonprofits and government agencies. I worked with the American Red Cross, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, Johns Hopkins University, and other organizations on projects that dealt with everything from disaster relief to invasive species mitigation to GIS and more.

Service is a core value of mine. Following AmeriCorps, I continued my service-oriented work at  the [Ding Darling Wildlife Society](https://dingdarlingsociety.org/) and as an [Emergency Medical Technician](/emt).
