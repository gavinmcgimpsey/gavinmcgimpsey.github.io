Growing up in Idaho without any major league sports, it wasn't until I was serving in [AmeriCorps](/americorps) that I got to attend a Major League Baseball game. Walking into Oriole Park at Camden Yards, I immediately fell in love, and I've been an O's fan ever since. I also follow the NL West (having lived where the Rockies and the Diamondbacks were the home team) and enjoy going to Cardinals games here in St. Louis

## Scorekeeping

I like keeping score. Filling up a scorecard helps me stay engaged with the game and helps me appreciate each game's "story." I use the [Reisner Scorekeeping](http://www.reisnerscorekeeping.com/) method, which is a brilliant design that doesn't require back-tracking and makes it easy to see what happened play-by-play throughout the game.
