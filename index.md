Hi, I'm Gavin!

I'm in Los Angeles these days, after living and working everywhere from Gambier, Ohio, to Sanibel Island, Florida, to Phoenix, Arizona, and lots of places in between. Wherever I go, I try to go all out: I was ranked the [#1 rookie bridge player in North America](https://web3.acbl.org/mpraces/?year=2012&race=MMA) in 2012. After earning a perfect score on the Law School Admissions Test, I taught hundreds of others to achieve their best &mdash; to [rave reviews](/testimonials). I've also served in [AmeriCorps](/americorps) and as an [EMT](/emt). Now, I'm excited to be looking toward the start of my legal career.

### Interests

* Wildnerness [backpacking](/hiking) &mdash; I spent a few weeks solo thru-hiking the [Benton MacKaye Trail](http://www.bmta.org/) in the southeastern US.
* Bridge &mdash; mostly on [BBO](https://www.bridgebase.com/) these days.
* Sailing &mdash; always willing to crew.
* [Baseball](/baseball) &mdash; I'm hoping to visit every MLB stadium, and I love keeping score.
* Cooking and cocktails &mdash; especially trying something new.
