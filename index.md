Hi, I'm Gavin! I'm a law student at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://law.wustl.edu/).

I strive for excellence. I was ranked the [#1 rookie bridge player in North America](https://web3.acbl.org/mpraces/?year=2012&race=MMA) in 2012. After earning a perfect score on the Law School Admissions Test, I taught hundreds of others to acheive their best &mdash; to [rave reviews](/testimonials/). Now, I'm excited to be looking towards the start of my legal career.

### Interests

* Wildnerness [backpacking](/hiking) &mdash; I spent a few weeks solo thru-hiking the [Benton MacKaye Trail](http://www.bmta.org/) in the southeastern US.
* [Bridge](/bridge) &mdash; mostly on [BBO](https://www.bridgebase.com/) these days.
* Sailing &mdash; always willing to crew.
* [Baseball](/baseball) &mdash; I'm hoping to visit every MLB stadium, and I love keeping score.
* Cooking and cocktails &mdash; get in touch if you'd like an invitation to my next potluck!
