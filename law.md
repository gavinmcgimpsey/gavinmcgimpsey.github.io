I recently received my JD, *summa cum laude*, from Washington University in St. Louis, where I was a member of the *Washington University Law Review* and the National Moot Court team.

I have been a summer associate at [Fennemore](https://fennemorelaw.com), [Kirkland & Ellis](https://kirkland.com), [Munger, Tolles & Olson](https://mto.com), and [Susman Godfrey](https://www.susmangodfrey.com).

Prior to law school I worked as a file clerk at [Schmidt McElwee & Gordon](https://www.azfamilylaw.com/), Phoenix's premier family law firm.
