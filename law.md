I am a second-year law student at Washington University in St. Louis. I have a range of interests focused on litigation and trial practice.

Following my first year, I was a summer associate at [Fennemore](https://fennemorelaw.com), one of the oldest and best-established firms in Phoenix.

Prior to law school I worked as a file clerk at [Schmidt McElwee & Gordon](https://www.azfamilylaw.com/), Phoenix's premier family law firm.
