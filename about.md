Hi, I'm Gavin! I'm a law student at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://law.wustl.edu/).

I strive for excellence. I was ranked the [#1 rookie bridge player in North America](https://web3.acbl.org/mpraces/?year=2012&race=MMA) in 2012. After earning a perfect score on the Law School Admissions Test, I taught hundreds of others to acheive their best &mdash; to [rave reviews](/testimonials/). Now, I'm excited to be looking towards the start of my legal career.

### Projects

#### Russell

I spoke at RubyConf on logic programming, and wrote a demo framework based on [cKanren](http://scheme2011.ucombinator.org/papers/Alvis2011.pdf) [PDF].
