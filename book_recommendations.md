<img class="portrait" src="/images/Will-to-Change-Cover.jpg" alt="Gavin McGimpsey's top book recommendation: The Will to Change, by bell hooks">

If I had to pick one book for everyone to read, it would be this one. **The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love**, by bell hooks, is revelatory and soul-affirming. I care about creating a healthier image of masculinity for myself and others—a work in progress, of course, but far further along thanks to this book.
